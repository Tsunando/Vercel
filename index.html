<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Buy Cheapest Tobacco Products in Canada?</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobacco products have been around for a long time already, giving people basically the nicotine hits that they desire whenever they feel stressed, anxious, or uncomfortable in their surroundings. Others then use them with their friends or colleagues as a way to socialize.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These products, however, come with a cost.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the health risks associated with tobacco, governments around the world are now doing the best they can just to hike their prices. From added taxes down to a plethora of regulations, tobacco companies don’t have a choice but to adhere to them. This begs the question of whether you can still buy them at a low price, especially here in Canada.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulating Tobacco Products in Canada</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Canada, the </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/smoking-tobacco/regulating-tobacco-vaping.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobacco and Vaping Products Act or TVPA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps regulate the manufacture, sale, labelling, and promotion of tobacco products as well as vaping products that are being sold in the country. Its regulations aim to advance the strategy of the government to protect its citizens from tobacco-related death and disease.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some key purposes of TVPA include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting the health of Canadians in light of the mounting evidence implicating tobacco use as the key reason behind debilitating and fatal diseases</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting young persons and others from inducements to use tobacco products and the risks associated with them</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting the health of young persons through restricting access to tobacco products</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing the public from being deceived or misled with respect to the health hazards of using tobacco products</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosting public awareness of the health hazards of using tobacco products</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other laws that regulate tobacco products include the following:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Non-smokers’ Health Act</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This act addresses issues related to using tobacco, vaping and cannabis products, including secondhand smoke and aerosol, in federally-regulated workplaces like banks, commercial aircraft, and federal government offices. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Excise Act</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Tobacco products manufactured in Canada or imported into Canada must be subject to excise duties or taxes. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Provincial, territorial, and municipal laws</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Provincial, territorial, and municipal governments must regulate tobacco and vaping products and their use. They have the power to prohibit tobacco use in certain public spaces, add more taxes, and so on.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Factors Affecting the Prices of Tobacco</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous factors that could affect the general prices of tobacco products in Canada. Some of these factors include the following:</span>
<h3><b>Federal and Provincial Taxes</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the primary factors that affect the prices of tobacco products in Canada is tobacco taxation. The federal government, as mentioned, aims to protect Canadians from the harmful health risks caused by tobacco products. Therefore, they impose excise duties on cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco, pushing their prices up. Provinces then add their own taxes, which is the reason why the same products may cost differently across regions. </span>
<h3><b>Strict Government Restrictions</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prices of tobacco products may also be impacted by strict regulations by the government, particularly on their sales, packaging, and marketing. As Canada enforces standardized plain packaging, health warning labels, and restrictions on flavoured tobacco, manufacturers have to adhere to the imposed regulations and restrictions, leading to an increase in production costs. </span>
<h3><b>Rising Costs of Raw Tobacco</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco can only maintain their quality if they are made from high-quality raw ingredients. The cost of raw tobacco, however, has continued to increase over the past few years due to global supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and transportation costs. You can then expect specialty or premium tobacco products to become more expensive since they rely heavily on high-quality leaves and top-notch processing.</span>
<h3><b>The Existence of the Black Market</b></h3>
<a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadas-illegal-tobacco-industry-now-surpassing-legal-sales-in-parts-of-the-country-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal tobacco sales</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> create an underground market, or black market, that competes directly with legal retailers and shops. Some consumers turn to these lower-cost alternatives, which reduces demand for taxed products. This then influences and affects the pricing strategies of legal retailers and shops. Fortunately, the government is now keen on curbing illegal tobacco sales, protecting tax revenue and allowing legitimate retailers to earn.</span>
